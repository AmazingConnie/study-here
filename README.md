# StudyHere

For this activity, I made a simple website that would help students book a room for a study space
at the university. At the beginning of the sprint, I had only a navigation bar setup. But by the end of the sprint, I was able to setup a search bar, and available rooms on campus. I spent the entirety of our asynchronous class on 11/25 working on this activity (i.e. 3 hours).

For outside resources, I consulted AI and [Tom Dekan's article](https://tomdekan.com/articles/react-search-bar?ref=r-react) on creating the search bar component. These resources helped me with handling the input and returning results. 

In the future, I want to flesh out this project to include login info and a form for reserving a room. I also want to categorize spaces by campus and building. 

I plan on deploying this project to Vercel.
